# 🌾 BLINK-Wrapper: A Command-Line GWAS Tool with Docker

This project provides a lightweight and user-friendly command-line wrapper for running Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) using the [BLINK](https://github.com/YaoZhou89/BLINK) method in R. It’s ideal for researchers who want to perform GWAS on VCF and phenotype files without installing R packages manually.
