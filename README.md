# ðŸŒ¾ BLINK-Wrapper: A Command-Line GWAS Tool with Docker

This project provides a lightweight and user-friendly command-line wrapper for running Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) using the [BLINK](https://github.com/YaoZhou89/BLINK) method in R. Itâ€™s ideal for researchers who want to perform GWAS on VCF and phenotype files without installing R packages manually.

##  Features

- Accepts VCF genotype and phenotype files as input
- Automatically performs GWAS using BLINK
- Generates Manhattan and QQ plots
- Dockerized: No need to install R or BLINK manually
- Works on macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon), Linux, and Windows with Docker
